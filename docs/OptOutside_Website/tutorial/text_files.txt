homepage - part one - paragraph text:

This website site is devoted to sharing a little information about one of the most amazing inventions: the humble pencil.

Pencils are great because they help us share out thoughts, feelings, and ideas. You can use pencils for writing or drawing.They do not require Internet access, and they do not require any special training.

And some pencils do not even require sharpening!

Pencils are important tools in many professions, from composing to construction

I hope you will enjoy this site, and when you are finishing visiting these pages, you will be as impressed with the humble pencil as I am!

homepage - part two - featured pages text:

This website has a curated selection of some of the best pencil photos found in the internet. The images can help you look at pencils in a whole new way.

Pencils have changed the course of history! The discovery of graphite, the key component of pencils, was once regarded as a military secret!

The media center has a selection of pencil films from YouTube, Vimeo, and streaming from our own website. Nothing tells a story like a movie!

homepage - part three - notable pencil users text:

Thomas Edison had his pencils specially made by Eagle Pencil. Each pencil was three inches long, was thicker than standard pencils and had softer graphite than was normally available.

Vincent van Gogh used only Faber pencils as they were "superior to Carpenters pencils, a capital black and most agreeable".

A method is developed of mixing powdered graphite with clay and forming the mixture into rods that were then fired in a kiln. By varying the ratio of graphite to clay, the hardness of the graphite rod could also be varied.

Frequently Asked Questions - Pencils

questions:

When was the pencil invented?

The first attempt to manufacture graphite sticks from powdered graphite was in Nuremberg, Germany, in 1662. It used a mixture of graphite, sulphur, and antimony. Residual graphite from a pencil stick is not poisonous, and graphite is harmless if consumed.

Where does the lead in pencils come from?

In the 16th century, a large deposit of pure, solid graphite was discovered in Borrowdale, England. This was the first time in recorded history that high quality, solid graphite had been found. When metallurgists first encountered this substance, they thought it was some sort of black lead, rather than a form of carbon. Thus, they called it “plumbago”, which is derived from “plumbum”, which is Latin for “lead”.

It didn’t take people long to realize that solid sticks of high quality graphite were good for marking things. At that point, this newly discovered substance from the mines of Borrowdale became extremely valuable. So much so that guards were eventually posted at the entrance to the mine and laws were passed to stop people from stealing the solid graphite. In addition, once a sufficient stock of the graphite was mined, the mine itself would be flooded until more graphite was needed.

Of course, sticks of pure graphite are fairly brittle, so people started embedding them in various things such as hollowed out pieces of wood and also simply wrapped tightly in sheep skin. Thus, the pencil was officially born with a core of solid graphite, which was known then as black lead. The tradition of calling sticks of graphite “lead” has endured to this day.

What does hb on a pencil stand for?

Many pencils across the world, and almost all in Europe, are graded on the European system using a continuum from H (for hardness) to B (for blackness), as well as F, a letter arbitrarily chosen to indicate midway between HB and H. (It is a persistent myth that F stands for fine; F pencils are no more fine or easily.
